== Introduction
Lacewing's Collection of Memes contains memes created and/or collected by Lacewing and possibly others. Besides obvious functionalities, it can be a playground for practicing document writing and/or typsetting skills.

== Usage

_Meme the memes!_ +
And if their formats don't fit your needs, convert them. HTML can be converted to pretty much anything (not really, but to a variety of formats).

=== Guidelines

==== Content

* upon editing (excluding simple typo correction and such), please add your name and optionally, email address to the "author line" or such data
* by not adding your author information, you choose not to be credited for the work
* *reuse (refer)* content and sources when possible

==== Format

* use markup languages which can be *easily converted to `HTML`*; +
	`AsciiDoc` (`.adoc`) is encouraged
* format text reasonably, make it *easy to read and edit*
* check spelling and grammar, also punctuation and typesetting

==== File Management

* use *flat* folder structure, meaning no creating lower-level folder; *`.` indicates 'folder'*, +
	e.g. `general.punchline.adoc` for `general/punchline.adoc`
* use lowercase, with *`-` replacing white spaces*, +
	e.g. `calamity-mod` for "Calamity Mod"
* follow special naming rules, +
	e.g. `README.adoc` and `LICENSE`
* viewable content in `content/`, name after *full names*
* sources and *reusable parts* in `src/`, name after *abbreviations*
* images, *excluding icons*, in `images/`, name after *abbreviations*
* *icon images* in `images/icons/`, name after *full names*
* audios in `audios/`, video in `videos/`, both name after *abbreviations*
* styles (`CSS`, etc.) in `styles/`, name after *full names*

==== Frequency

* small typo PRs are unlikely to be merged
* combine updates into 1 or a few PRs if you have a bunch of them
