[abstract]
== Introduction
Lacewing's Collection of Memes contains memes created and/or collected by Lacewing and possibly others. Besides obvious functionalities, it can be a playground for practicing document writing and/or typsetting skills.

== Usage
You'll have to download the files and preview/convert them, because GitHub's `AsciiDoc` rendering lacks many features.

*`asciidoctor`* is the `AsciiDoc` processoer for this project.

=== Get Files
____
You can download a repository to your machine.
____

To utilize Git features, you may https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository[clone a repository].

If you just want s snapshot of a repostory, you can https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives[download an archive of a repository].

=== Styling
`HTML` supports customization, so does `AsciiDoc` since it converts to `HTML`. Feel free to apply your own style sheets and even scripts.

Some converters also support styling `PDF` output.

=== Converting
Here are some suggestions for getting memeable output.

First, convert `AsciiDoc` to `HTML`. (For those who straightaway go to `PDF`, you nerds)

Then, you can convert it to

* images (`PNG` `JPG` etc.) by capturing screenshots of `HTML` elements (by using your browser's 'inspection' tools) or taking screenshots
* animated pictures or videos if the meme is dynamic using screen recorders
* `PDF` via browsers 'printing'

_Meme the memes!_

* use *`asciidoctor`* for processing `AsciiDoc`
* format text reasonably, make it *easy to read and edit*
* check spelling and grammar, also punctuation and typesetting

==== File Management

* use *flat* folder structure, meaning no creating lower-level folder; *`.` indicates 'folder'*, +
	e.g. `general.punchline.adoc` for `general/punchline.adoc`
* use lowercase, with *`-` replacing white spaces*, +
	e.g. `calamity-mod` for "Calamity Mod"
* follow special naming rules, +
	e.g. `README.adoc` and `LICENSE`
* viewable content in `content/`, name after *full names*

* images, *excluding icons*, in `images/`, name after *abbreviations*
* *icon images* in `images/icons/`, name after *full names*
* audios in `audios/`, video in `videos/`, both name after *abbreviations*
